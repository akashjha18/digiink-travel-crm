/**
 * Replaces the old tenant-DB-resolution guard now that there is a single
 * shared database. This step still does real work though:
 *   1. Loads the Client row (with its Plan) for req.auth.clientId
 *   2. Re-derives the subscription status from dates (never trusts a
 *      possibly-stale cached status column) and checks it against
 *      allowedStatuses
 *   3. Attaches req.client (with plan) so requireEntitlement/requirePermission
 *      can read it, and req.clientId as the mandatory scope for every query
 *      that follows
 *
 * Every controller downstream must filter its Prisma queries by
 * req.clientId. There is no database-level wall anymore — this is the
 * wall, so it must run before every tenant-facing route.
